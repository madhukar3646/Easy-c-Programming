--> int radius,area; // memory locations will create with the variable names radius and area
--> By default radius=0, area=0;
--> input value will store at address of radius variable
--> radius=8; 
--> area=3.14*radius*radius; //area=pi*r*r is the formulae of area of a circle.pi=3.14
--> arithmetic calculation will be done on the leftside of the assignment operator(=);
--> That calculated result will be stored in the variable area.
--> Finally the oputput will be Area of the circle is 200
