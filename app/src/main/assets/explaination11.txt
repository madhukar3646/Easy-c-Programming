--> For loop is a programming language conditional iterative statement which is used to check for certain conditions and then repeatedly execute a block of code as long as those conditions are met.
--> for(int i=0;i<5;i++)// for(initialization; condition;incr/decr)
--> i value is intialized with 0 // i=0;
--> i<5 // 0<5 condition true so the instructions of for loop block will be execute
--> then i++ //i=i+1 // i=0+1 // i=1;
--> then i<5 // 1<5 condition true so the instructions of for loop block will be execute
--> like this iterations will execute until the condition false.
--> at 6th iteration i=5  i<5  5<5 condition will be false.
--> Control flow will be come out from the for loop and execute remaining statements of the program.
