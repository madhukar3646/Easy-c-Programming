void sum(int c,int d); ==> it is a function prototype.
--> Here 
void sum(int c,int d) is a method written below the main method.
--> void sum(int c,int d) ==> This function is expecting two integer values.
--> sum(10,20); ==> function call with 10 and 20 integer values.
--> void sum(int c,int d) ==> 10 will be store in c and 20 will be store in d
--> result=c+d ==> result=10+20;
--> output is: sum of c,d is 30
