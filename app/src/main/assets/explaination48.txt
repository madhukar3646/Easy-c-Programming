--> A function is collection of statements. 
--> syntax is returntype f-name(){ }
--> ex: int sum(){ } or void sum(){ } etc.
--> void means there is no retun type.
--> We need to call methods from main() method only.
--> call a method example sum(); ==> functionname();

--> 
void sum(); ==> it is a function prototype.
--> Need to declare function prototype to use userdefined functions.
--> Here void sum() is a method written below the main method.
--> sum(); this statement in main method will be execute the sum() method or function.
--> Then all the instructions inside void sum() method will be execute.
--> sum of a,b is 30 will be print then control will go back to main method.
--> After completing the void sum() method instructions control will goes to the main method and remaining staements will be execute.
