--> int a=99,b=0;
--> char ch1,ch2='s';
--> ch1=a; ==> ch1=99 ==> here 99 is an integer.
--> But we are assigning integer value to ch1 charecter variable.
--> 99 ascii code charecter is 'c' so internally it will convert and store in ch1.
--> b=ch2; here b is an integer variable 
--> b='s' ==> s ascii code is 115 so it will convert and store in b.
--> ch1 value is c 
--> b value is 115
