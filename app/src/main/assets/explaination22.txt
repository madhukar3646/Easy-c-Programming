--> Prime number means a number that is divisible only by itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
--> int n, i, flag = 0; //declaration and flag variable intialization to 0.
--> Enter a number 6 then n=6
-->  for(i = 2; i <= n/2; ++i)
--> if(n%i == 0) // condition for checking the number is divisible or not with i values
--> here n=6 and i value will be change for loop iterations.
--> i=2 ==> i<6/2 ==> 2<3 true 
--> true block if(n%i == 0) ==> 6%2==0 ==> true then 
--> flag = 1; // flag varibale is assigned with 1
--> break;    // this will terminate the loop
--> if (n == 1) // 4==1 false so else block will be execute
--> if (flag == 0) // false so else block printf will be execute
--> 6 is not a prime number.

Note: 
--> In the above program if(n%i == 0) condition will be false for every iteration for prime numbers like 2,3,5,7..etc.
--> here we have started for loop from i=2 because we are checking the values except 1 and itself of a number.
--> if any number will be divisible except 1 and itself then it will be a prime.
--> But 1 is neither a prime nor a composite number.
